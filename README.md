# Project Title

Welcome to the Little Projects repository where you can find many small pieces of code including games and other fun programs. This is a python project repository and contains many different small projects that do not relate to each other and that are too small to be made into a repository (yet).

## Getting Started

To contribute to this repository you will have to fork the repository and then clone it to your local machine. You will then submit a pull request in order for your changes to go live.

1. Fork the repository. [Learn how to fork a repo.](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine. To do this, go to the home page of the repository and then click on the green `Clone or download` button. Copy the Https... . Then go to your command line, navigate to the directory where you want to clone it and use git to clone it by typing: `git clone ` + the copied url:
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Python-Projects.git
  ```
3. Finally, set up the original upstream repository. To do this, move into the Python-Projects directory. Then use git to set up the upstream repository as so:
  ```
  $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/MaliciousFiles/Python-Projects.git
  ```
4. You can then create a branch or make any other commits and changes. Once you have tested that your changes were successful, open a pull request and write a description of your changes.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.6 or greater

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
